# Introduction

Recently, I was given a question that tested my knowledge on the prototype-inheritence modal and function chaining.

What is function chaining? How can we implement this using prototype model? Can we do it without the class based instance creation using "new" keyword?

These are some answers I tried to answer in this video.
