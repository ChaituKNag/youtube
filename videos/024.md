# Introduction

I recently attended a technical interview with a very huge tech giant company. The process was pleasant but unfortunately I could not pass through that interview.

This is one of the questions that I was asked in the interview that was a live coding question. I wrote the answer but it was not elegant. There were minor glitches that finally did not work in my favor.

In this video, I attempt to teach how to solve that in a proper way!
